High speed networks connecting clusters


Network switches seem to bottleneck a lot of builds and capable hardware is prohibitively expensive.  

Is it possible to make more affordable network switches in the 10 Gb range? Is this a copper interface or optical?  

Required blocks:
  CPU to control messages and protocol  
  FPGA to support high speed interface and possibly process signal to feed to the CPU
